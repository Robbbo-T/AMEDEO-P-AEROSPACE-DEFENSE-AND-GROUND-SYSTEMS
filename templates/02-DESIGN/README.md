# Phase 02 - Design

## Overview
This phase translates requirements into detailed technical designs and architectural solutions for the Configuration Item.

## Purpose
Create comprehensive design documentation that serves as the blueprint for building the {{CI_NAME}} ({{CI_TYPE}}).

## Key Deliverables
- [ ] System Architecture Document (SAD)
- [ ] Detailed Design Document (DDD)
- [ ] Interface Design Specifications
- [ ] Design Models (3D CAD, UML, etc.)

## Design Approaches by CI Type

### Hardware Design
- **Mechanical Design**: CAD models, engineering drawings
- **Electrical Design**: Schematics, PCB layouts
- **Materials Selection**: Material specifications, test plans
- **Manufacturing Considerations**: DFM analysis, tooling requirements

### Software Design
- **Architecture Design**: System architecture, component diagrams
- **Detailed Design**: Class diagrams, sequence diagrams
- **Database Design**: Entity relationship diagrams, schemas
- **User Interface Design**: Mockups, user experience flows

### Document Design
- **Information Architecture**: Document structure, navigation
- **Content Design**: Writing style guides, templates
- **Visual Design**: Layout, typography, graphics
- **Accessibility Design**: Section 508 compliance, usability

## Applicable Standards
