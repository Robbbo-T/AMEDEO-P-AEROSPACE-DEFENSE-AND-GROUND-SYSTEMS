# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the AMEDEO-P Aerospace Defense and Ground Systems community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community while maintaining the highest standards of professional conduct expected in aerospace, defense, and ground systems engineering.

- Following established engineering processes and procedures
- Prioritizing safety and mission success above personal convenience
- Sharing knowledge and expertise for collective advancement
- Respecting intellectual property and proprietary information

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Security and Classification Considerations

Given the nature of aerospace, defense, and ground systems work:
- All community members must respect classification levels and access controls
- Discussions involving classified or proprietary information must occur in appropriate secure channels
- Export control regulations must be followed for all international interactions
- Security incidents must be reported through proper channels

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at conduct@amedeo-p.aero. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Escalation Process
1. **Direct Resolution**: Address issues directly with involved parties when appropriate
2. **Team Lead Involvement**: Escalate to team leads for technical or process issues
3. **Management Review**: Involve management for serious conduct issues
4. **Legal/Security**: Involve legal and security teams for violations involving:
   - Classified information
   - Export control violations
   - Safety protocol breaches
   - Criminal activity

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
